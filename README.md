A clean, professional navbar with mobile responsiveness
A striking hero section with gradient effects

A comprehensive footer with navigation links


add smooth navigation from the landing page to the Features section. We'll update the Hero and Navbar components to include navigation links.

Added React Router for navigation

Updated the Navbar with:
A new "Trade" link in both desktop and mobile menus
Proper active state highlighting
Login and Sign up buttons now link to the trading dashboard
Updated App.tsx with routes for:
